# rustbook-in-code
A chapter-by-chapter reproduction of the code in the 'Rust Book' (https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)

The 'src/<filename>.rs' files are meant to be self-contained reproductions of the content of the book. 
I created them as notes to use to follow-along with as I went through the book.
